# Python for everyday tasks

## Why?

Many of the things we do manually everyday could be automatized to save time (something like 5 very precious minutes a day).

Also programming is fun.

## How?

The nicest studying material is this book:

https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

Advantages: online, free and with lots of examples (aka pieces of code to copy and paste into your text editor).

Disadvantages: not found.

## Why you need me if everything is written in the book?

Good question.

This teaching session is a general overview of concepts from the book + my own two fantastic scripts (23 and 7 lines long respectively) which, I believe, could actually improve life of a scientist.
