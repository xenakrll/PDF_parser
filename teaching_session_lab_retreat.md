# Python for everyday tasks

## Why?

Many of the things we do manually everyday could be automatized to save time (something like 5 very precious minutes a day).

Also programming is fun.

## How?

The nicest studying material is this book:

https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

Advantages: online, free and with lots of examples (aka pieces of code to copy and paste into your text editor).

Disadvantages: not found.

## Why you need me if everything is written in the book?

Good question.

This teaching session is a general overview of concepts from the book + my own two fantastic scripts (23 and 7 lines long respectively), which, I believe, could actually improve life of a scientist.

Let's have a look at the book... and at the script.

## In case we have time left - rules of good coding and how to use Git for your basic scripts.

Git sounds like something worth bothering with only for professional software developers? **This is not true**

Git is very helpful with any sort of scripts and not only scripts.

### Basic workflow

1. Create an empty repository on your favorite web service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.);
2. Create the folder on your computer you want to keep your project in;
3. Open this folder in terminal (either (i) right click>open in terminal (for Linux) or (ii) in terminal type *cd path/to/your/folder* (both Windows/Linux));
4. *​git clone https://github.com/usermane/repository_name*  will create local copy of your repository;
5. Start working on your project and whenever you make some progress worth saving do:
6. *​git add .* which will add all your files to the local repository
7. and then *​git commit ­am "commit description"*;
8. Now you have all your files and changes saved in your local repository. To send it to your GitHub do *git push*.
9. That's it!! Your project is saved in all possible ways and moreover you have easy access to every commit you made (to make a new one repeat steps 7-8).

Now you do not have to worry that you break the working code and will not be able to recover the good version! It is all there!
